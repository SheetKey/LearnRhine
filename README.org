* Learn Rhine

This is my personal attempt at both learning and documents [[https://github.com/turion/rhine][rhine]]. Rhine is an intriguing FRP library built on [[https://github.com/ivanperez-keera/dunai][dunai]], another intruiging FRP library. Dunai [[http://www.cs.nott.ac.uk/~psxip1/papers/2016-HaskellSymposium-Perez-Barenz-Nilsson-FRPRefactored-short.pdf][claims]] to address many issues with other FRP libraries by creating a foundational library for FRP. Documentation for rhine is sparse, so I hope to create some.
