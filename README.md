# Learn Rhine

This is my personal attempt at both learning and documents [rhine](https://github.com/turion/rhine). Rhine is an intriguing FRP library built on [dunai](https://github.com/ivanperez-keera/dunai), another intruiging FRP library. Dunai [claims](http://www.cs.nott.ac.uk/~psxip1/papers/2016-HaskellSymposium-Perez-Barenz-Nilsson-FRPRefactored-short.pdf) to address many issues with other FRP libraries by creating a foundational library for FRP. Documentation for rhine is sparse, so I hope to create some. 

## Hello haskell with rhine

```haskell
main :: IO ()
main = putStrLn "Hello world."
```
