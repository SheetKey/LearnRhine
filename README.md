# Learn Rhine

This is my personal attempt at both learning and documents [rhine](https://github.com/turion/rhine). Rhine is an intriguing FRP library built on [dunai](https://github.com/ivanperez-keera/dunai), another intruiging FRP library. Dunai [claims](http://www.cs.nott.ac.uk/~psxip1/papers/2016-HaskellSymposium-Perez-Barenz-Nilsson-FRPRefactored-short.pdf) to address many issues with other FRP libraries by creating a foundational library for FRP. Rhine adds [type level clocks](https://www.manuelbaerenz.de/files/Rhine.pdf) to dunai, allowing for input event handling and the management of many subsystems running on different time scalse. Documentation for rhine is sparse ([this](https://www.manuelbaerenz.de/files/Rhine.pdf) is pretty much it asside from a few examples), so I hope to create some. 

## Hello haskell with rhine

Rather than use do notation and monad stacks with `IO` to do things, 
we want to let rhine handle everything. 
Rhine provides several key types that we will use to create programs.
We will start with our goal type. Rhine provides the `Rhine` type, with accompanying
`flow` function. `Rhine` is analagous to `StateT a IO ()` and `flow` to `evalState`, were
we using `StateT` to manage our program.

```haskell
flow :: (Monad m, Clock m cl, Time cl ~ Time (In cl), Time cl ~ Time (Out cl)) => Rhine m cl () () -> m ()
```
```haskell
data Rhine m cl a b
```
